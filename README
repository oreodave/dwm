                     ______________________________


dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
============
  In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.  Optionally you
  will also need xinerama.

Installation
============
  Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into the
  /usr/local namespace by default).

  Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
  necessary as root):
  ,----
  | make clean install
  `----

Running dwm
===========
  Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:
  ,----
  | exec dwm
  `----

  In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that the
  DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly.  For example, to start
  dwm on the host foo.bar on display 1:
  ,----
  | DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm
  `----

  When editing and compiling this project, it may be cumbersome to
  restart dwm.  By adding the following to your .xinitrc, one may
  restart dwm simply by killing the process, which will be immediately
  spawned again by the XServer.
  ,----
  | while :
  | do
  |     dwm
  | done
  `----
  Any applications will still exist after dwm is restarted, but may not
  laid out before the restart.  Refer to the `rules` variable in
  config.h for automatic layout control.

Configuration
=============
  The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h and
  (re)compiling the source code.  Refer to dwm(1) (stored in this
  repository as well) to find more information.
